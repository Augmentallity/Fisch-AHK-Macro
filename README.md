# Fisch-AHK-Macro
Macro for roblox game fisch in Autohotkey
Inspired by [Cream's Fisch Macro (Free Edition)](https://github.com/Cweamy/Fisch-Cream-s-Macro)
(Code is a heavily modified version of Cream's code, please support them!!!)
I made this to learn more about AutoHotKey and also to try and make the code more readable
I do not plan on maintaining this for future versions of fisch so if this ever breaks, goodluck!
I do plan on rewriting and improving this macro

Instructions:
Install / Have Autohotkey v2.1 installed (or future versions)
Edit the macro file and change the value of the "Control" variable to whatever your rod's control is (default is 0.05) (MAKE SURE TO SAVE THE EDITED FILE)
Pull out your fishing rod in Roblox
Press the Camera button on the top right of the roblox window
Run the macro file
Press H to resize the roblox window (You need to do this)
Press N to start the macro
Press Esc to stop the macro (closes the AutoHotKey program, you need to run it again if you want to restart)

Known issues:
In some locations, the macro can randomly think it is "Reeling in" a fish when it isnt (some issue with colors, I'll fix later)
When "Reeling in" a fish, the macro can struggle identifying where the fish is, and generally sucks at keeping the fish in the reel bar
