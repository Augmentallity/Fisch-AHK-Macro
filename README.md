# Fisch-AHK-Macro
Macro for roblox game fisch in Autohotkey <br> 
Inspired by [Cream's Fisch Macro (Free Edition)](https://github.com/Cweamy/Fisch-Cream-s-Macro) <br>
(Code is a heavily modified version of Cream's code, please support them!!!) <br>
I made this to learn more about AutoHotKey and also to try and make the code more readable <br>
I do not plan on maintaining this for future versions of fisch so if this ever breaks, goodluck! <br> 

# Instructions:
1. Install / Have Autohotkey v2.1 installed (or future versions)
2. Download the [latest version](https://github.com/throwaway20000/Fisch-AHK-Macro/blob/main/latest.Ahk)
3. Edit the macro file and change the value of the "Control" variable to whatever your rod's control is (default is 0.05) (MAKE SURE TO SAVE THE EDITED FILE)
4. Pull out your fishing rod in Roblox
5. Press the Camera button on the top right of the roblox window
6. Run the macro file
7. Press H to resize the roblox window (You need to do this)
8. Press F to start/pause the macro
9. Press Esc to stop the macro (closes the AutoHotKey program, you need to run it again if you want to restart)

# Known issues:
In some locations, the macro can randomly think it is "Reeling in" a fish when it isnt <br>
- This is because the macro uses colors of pixels on screen, and certain areas can confuse the bot
- To fix this I reccomend going in first person
